    <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</h3>
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE PLAYING ANY MOBILE GAMES OR/AND USING THE MPL PLATFORM.
If You do not agree with any part of these Terms of Use or/and Privacy Policy, kindly refrain from playing any Mobile Games or otherwise using Our services on the Platform. 
Hence, We insist that You read these Terms and Privacy Policy and let Us know at ibigplay.com@Gmail.com if You have any questions regarding the same. We will try Our best to answer Your queries.
Ibig Play is the renowned brand of Coolboots Media Private limited ("Ibig Play"). Through Ibig Play and along with different sub-pages under Ibig Play App, it operates separate portals and provides platform through which Participants/Players/users can play various Ibig Play skill based games and also fantasy sports based on skill. Ibig Play as used herein shall be construed as a collective reference to Ibig Play and the Ibig Play App.
Ibig Play has created a mobile based app platform where players can come together and play games. For providing the platform, Ibig Play charges a predefined platform fee. Each player who registers on Ibig Play app can participate in practice championships, coin championships, cash championships & promotional championships. Downloading Ibig Play app and creating an account is free and requires a player to share certain information like email address, mobile number, state he/she is playing from, etc.
Coin championships have an entry fee of coins and coins in prizes. Users get free coins everyday by using the app.
Practice championships have no entry fee and have cash prizes that are fully or partially sponsored by Ibig Play
Promotional championships may or may not have an entry fee, and carry cash prize that may be partially or fully sponsored by Ibig Play.
Cash championships have an entry fee that users pay, entry fee may be partially sponsored by Ibig Play in some cases. These championships carry cash prizes that may/ may not be partially or fully sponsored by Ibig Play
Each player, who creates an account with Ibig Play, has a wallet (cash balance) on the app. To play cash championships, a player is required to add cash into his wallet. In any single transaction, this can be a minimum of Re 1, but is liable to change in the future as per business requirements. Cash can be added using various forms of online payment methods like credit cards, debit cards, online banking etc.. Our payment gateway service providers are Paytm and CashFree (may change later). The cash a player adds into his wallet can be used to pay entry fees for championships. If the aggregate cash addition in the wallet exceeds Rs 20,000, then Player shall be required to share his PAN card (Aadhaar shall be required if PAN is not available).

Ibig Play collects part of the total entry fee pool in a championship as platform charge (platform fee). This fee is conditional on factors such as user participation (complete/ incomplete) & others. There are a few special championships offered with a 0% platform charge. In practice, the platform fee charge varies from championship to championship and is liable to change in the future. The remaining amount (entry fee pool less the platform charge) is added back into the wallets of players that are top winners in the championship based on a pre-decided prize distribution that is presented to them before the championship starts. Prize distribution can be different for every championship. If sum of entry fee given by users is less than prize distribution to be given, then the extra amount is contributed by Ibig Play considering it as promotion cost and platform fee is not taken by Ibig Play for these championships. From the point of view of Ibig Play, only the platform fee charged is the "transaction value" and constitutes the sole consideration for the supply of services by Ibig Play and rest of the amount which gets collected and distributed amongst Users does not constitute the consideration for the supply of services and thus is not the transaction value for Ibig Play.
Winning amount is added to the wallet balance of the player and entry fee is deducted from the wallet balance.
Players can withdraw cash won from their wallets based on pre-defined limits which are mentioned in user's wallet in the app. Maximum withdrawal per day is capped at Rs 2000 which is liable to change as per business requirements.
Withdrawals are processed through Paytm and UPI transfers. UPI transfers are charged at a nominal service fee.
All information collected from Users, such as registration and credit card information, is subject to Ibig Play Privacy Policy
